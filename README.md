# TruckersMP-Launcher

## Launcher Info

The launcher idea came to me after the TSRVTC wanting many features, yet they were in seperate programs. I assigned myself the task to fulfill what the VTC wanted but with one program.

After much thinking and planning, I began to do what I learned in college. I made the GUI of the launcher first and planned out what each function was needed. Now this was a big task for me, I was and still am, new to C# and Winforms but I was so dedicated to achieve my task I began to research many hours on stackoverflow and other resources that I came across. Some people who gave me help were nice and some.. well lets say I wish I never bothered.

Finally I had the outline of the task I had set and completed it (Few Bugs) but after much feed back from the VTC I decided to improve were I could and learn along the way.
